# ProtonOS
Welcome to my latest project, ProtonOS! Made by a guy with a crazy intention to make an OS (by the help of Microsoft Copilot, cheers Jeff) willing to take in the adventure of advanced C/C++ coding, multiple compiling processes, and a whole lot of errors. It won't be windows or macOS Ventura, but it WILL function. 

Components:
- Windows 11 Pro (unactivated cos i'm broke) by Microsoft
- Copilot (cos i'm dumb and inexperienced) by Microsoft
- Sheer determination by me
- Precompiled Binaries by lordmilko
-
