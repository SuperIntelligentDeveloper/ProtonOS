# ProtonOS
Welcome to my latest project, ProtonOS! Made by a guy with a crazy intention to make an OS (by the help of Microsoft Copilot, cheers Jeff) willing to take in the adventure of advanced C/C++ coding, multiple compiling processes, and a whole lot of errors. It won't be windows or macOS Ventura, but it WILL function.
